        "**Descriptive Statistics**\n",
        "Descriptive statistics focus on summarizing and presenting the characteristics of a dataset. This branch of statistics organizes, displays, and describes data through various methods, allowing researchers to understand the data at hand without making predictions or generalizations beyond it. Key features include:\n",
        "Purpose: To describe and summarize the characteristics of a dataset.\n",
        "Methods: Utilizes measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of spread (range, variance, standard deviation), and graphical representations (charts, graphs).\n",
        "Result Format: Presents results in tables, charts, or graphs.\n",
        "Example: If a researcher collects the scores of 100 students in a test, descriptive statistics can be used to calculate the average score and the distribution of scores to illustrate overall performance\n",

        "Inferential statistics, on the other hand, allow researchers to make conclusions or predictions about a larger population based on a sample of data. This branch is essential for hypothesis testing and making inferences that extend beyond the immediate data. Key features include:\n",
        "Purpose: To make generalizations or predictions about a larger population based on sample data.\n",
        "Methods: Involves techniques such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis, and correlation.\n",
        "Result Format: Presents results in terms of probabilities or estimates.\n",
        "Example: Using the scores from a sample of 100 students to infer the average score of all students in a country. This involves statistical methods to estimate population parameters based on the sample.\n",
